# Drum machine
Beagleboard Bela + pepper based drum machine written in Supercollider

This is WIP and messy, will be cleaned up later.

4 analog inputs control reverb

4 trigger inputs control drums

Buttons swap instrument sets

Audio input is passed through reverb and mixed with drums

Supports midi input over USB to CV and trigger, currently only tested on a keyboard, but will expand on that later.
